"""Remediation suggestions.

Every active finding gets 2-3 actionable suggestions:

  1. first_aid        — quick mitigation to stop bleeding today (WAF rule,
                        disable endpoint, rotate credentials, restrict access)
  2. full_remediation — root fix (upgrade to fixed version, code fix, patch)
  3. scanner_guidance — the fix text the scanner itself provided (ZAP solution,
                        Wapiti sol, Trivy FixedVersion, Nuclei reference)

First-aid / full-fix texts come from a curated CWE -> guidance map with a
sensible generic fallback.
